<h2> On-Line Contests </h2>

<p>The USACO holds periodic web-based contests during the academic year,
and in the late Spring conducts the US Open, our "national championship" exam.
Contests generally run for three to five continuous hours in length,
although for maximum flexibility, you are free to schedule this block
of time anywhere within a Friday-to-Monday contest weekend --- your
timer starts when you log into the contest and download the problems.
Contest tasks are presented on the web, and you submit your final
solutions through a simple web interface. Participation is free
and open to all. </p>

<p> Contests are offered in four divisions:
<ul>

<li><b>Bronze</b>, for students who have recently learned to program,
but who have no training in algorithms beyond basic concepts like
sorting and binary search.

<li><b>Silver</b>, for students who are beginning to learn fundamental
problem-solving techniques (e.g., recursive search, greedy algorithms)
and fundamental data structures.
</li>

<li><b>Gold</b>, where students encounter more standard algorithms of
a more complex nature (e.g., shortest paths, dynamic programming) and
more advanced data structures.
</li>

<li><b>Platinum</b>, for advanced students who are well grounded in
algorithmic problem-solving techniques, who wish to challenge
themselves with sophisticated and more open-ended 
problems.  </li>

</ul></p>

<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">All participants start in the bronze
division, and those who score particularly well in a contest will be
promoted to the next division.  Contestants scoring particularly
highly will be automatically promoted to the next division while a 
contest is running; others will need to wait until results are announced
at the end of the contest to see if they meet the (contest-dependent)
cutoff for promotion.
</p>

<p>Detailed technical specifications and rules for our contests are 
available <a href="index.php?page=instructions">here</a>.

<h2>The Road to the IOI Team</h2>

Based on the results of the web-based contests throughout the year
(with particular emphasis on the US Open), as well as performance in
the on-line training pages, approximately 16..24 students are invited
to a rigorous academic training camp in the early summer, hosted at
Clemson University. At camp, half a dozen more contests in addition to
a full schedule of computing-related and extracurricular activities
fill out the week of activities.  At the end of camp, the top 4
students are selected by the USACO staff to represent the USA at the
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI).  The IOI is held each
summer by a different host country --- for example, Australia (2013),
Taiwan (2014), and Kazakhstan (2015).  The USACO occasionally also
participates in regional Olympiads, such as the Central European
Olympiad in Informatics (CEOI).  </p>

<p> To be eligible for selection as a USACO finalist and ultimately as
an IOI team member, you must be enrolled in a high school (or junior
high/middle school) for at least one semester in the school year
before the IOI. You can concurrently take courses at other
institutions, including colleges and universities. You must either be
a US citizen or a resident of the USA during the first half of the
school year. IOI team members from countries other than the USA
are not eligible to be USACO finalists (and this includes
students who have made commitments to other countries that could
conceivably result in their being selected for an IOI team
prior to USACO camp).
</p>

<p> To be selected as a finalist, you must excel in your participation
in USACO web-based contests through the year. The coaches may
drop one contest when averaging scores and determining trends, but a
student who misses several contests is less likely to be chosen. 
   Students in their senior year, and finalists from previous
years generally face a much stricter set of criteria
for selection than younger students. </p>

<p>Expenses for the USACO training camp are paid by the USACO, although
participants are asked to fund their own transportation to the camp if
possible. For the IOI, all expenses, including transportation, are
paid by USACO.</p>
